How to Use the Code:

- Copy and paste the code into a Python script file, e.g., checkers.py.
- Run the script using Python: python checkers.py.

Features to Expand:

- Multi-jump Captures: Currently, only one capture is allowed per turn.
- End Game Conditions: Implement logic to determine the winner or if no moves are available.
- Improved Move Validation: Handle more complex scenarios and prevent illegal moves more robustly.
