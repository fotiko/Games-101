Tic-Tac-Toe
-----------
The player ("X") makes the first move.
The AI ("O") responds using the Minimax algorithm, ensuring it plays optimally every time.
The game checks for a winner or draw after each move.

Snake
-----
Setup:
The snake is initialized with a starting length and position.
"Snake food" is appears randomly on the canvas, avoiding the snake's body.

Movement:
The snake moves continuously in the direction itâ€™s currently facing.
Arrow key presses change the direction.

Collision Detection:
If the snake collides with the walls or itself, the game ends.

Food Consumption:
When the snake's head moves to the food's position, the food is "eaten" and the snake grows longer.

Checkers
--------
Piece Movement: Regular pawns can move forward only, and kings can move in both directions.

- A move history or notation system.
- Ability to save and load game states.
