The player ("X") makes the first move.
The AI ("O") responds using the Minimax algorithm, ensuring it plays optimally every time.
The game checks for a winner or draw after each move.

- A move history or notation system.
- Ability to save and load game states.
- Sound effects for moves and captures.
